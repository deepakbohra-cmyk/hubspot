### Call Quality Analysis: NEW CALL

#### 1. What this call did well:

*   **Strong Positive Affirmations:** The frequent use of `ji ji ji`, `yes yes yes`, and `okay okay okay` (all appearing 3 times) indicates active listening, agreement, and a generally positive, reassuring tone. This aligns strongly with positive indicators from the "GOOD CALL PHRASES."
*   **Reassurance and Empathy:** The phrase `koi baat nahi` (2 times) suggests the agent is understanding and calming, potentially defusing any minor concerns or frustrations.
*   **Focus on Specific Content/Services:** The explicit and frequent mention of `a plus content` (3 times) shows the call is focused on delivering specific, relevant information about a product or service. This is a clear, topical discussion.
*   **Reduced Filler/Hesitation (compared to Bad Calls):** The new call has significantly lower counts of common filler words like `hai`, `toh`, `aap`, `ki`, `hain`, `kar`, `theek`, `okay` when compared to the "BAD CALL WORDS" list. This suggests more concise and confident communication. For example, `hai` appears 25 times in the new call vs. 583 in bad calls, and `toh` 11 times vs. 188.
*   **Information-Oriented Dialogue:** The phrases `depend karta hai` and the detailed explanation (`wo jo aap keh rahe hain na isme bank store aur a plus content isme included nahi hai so hamara 36000 hai hmm haan ji actually kya hota hai jo hamara a plus content hota hai`) demonstrate a structured approach to providing information and clarifying specifics, including pricing.

#### 2. What it needs to improve:

*   **Lack of Explicit Gratitude:** The absence of `thank you so much` (which appeared 4 times in good calls) indicates a missed opportunity for politeness and expressing appreciation.
*   **No Clear Customer Intent Captured (from agent perspective):** Phrases like `i want to` (from good calls, implying customer intent) are missing. While the agent is responding, the snippet doesn't show the agent proactively probing for the customer's specific needs or goals.
*   **Less Direct Address/Politeness Markers (compared to Good Calls):** The word `maam` (11 times in good calls) is absent. While `ji` is present, adding direct salutations can enhance professionalism. The word `aap` (178 times in bad calls, 0 in new) is also missing, which could be good (less accusatory) but might also reduce formal politeness if used appropriately.
*   **Initial Call Opening/Probing:** Phrases like `how may i help you` (6 times in bad calls, though generally good practice) or `hello yeah hi` (1 time in good calls) are not present, suggesting this snippet might be mid-conversation. If it's the start, it lacks a formal opening.

#### 3. Missing Effective Phrases (from GOOD CALL list):

The NEW CALL could benefit from incorporating these phrases to further enhance quality:

*   `thank you so much` (explicit gratitude)
*   `i will be` (commitment/future action)
*   `what is it` (clarification or invitation for customer to elaborate)
*   `dekh liya hai` (acknowledgement of receipt or understanding)
*   `maam tell me` (invitation for the customer to speak/share)
*   `for the ecommerce business` / `we provide complete account management services` (broader service context, if applicable)

#### 4. Tone and Structure Feedback:

*   **Tone:** The tone appears to be **informative, responsive, and reassuring**. The triple affirmations (`ji ji ji`, `yes yes yes`, `okay okay okay`) convey attentiveness and agreement. The use of `koi baat nahi` adds a supportive element. The explanation about `a plus content` and pricing feels direct and transparent, without apparent frustration or excessive hesitation.
*   **Structure:** The call snippet demonstrates a **structured explanation phase**. It seems to start with acknowledging the customer's query (`hello hello yes`, `yes actually wo jo aap keh rahe hain na isme`), followed by a clear clarification of what is *not* included (`bank store aur a plus content isme included nahi hai`). It then provides a specific detail (price: `hamara 36000 hai`) and further elaborates on the concept (`actually kya hota hai jo hamara a plus content hota hai`). This suggests a clear thought process in answering a specific question, moving from direct answer to detailed explanation. It's a conversation flow focused on conveying information accurately.
